# Magellan EV Tracker v2.0 - Donut Chart Fix

This package contains the fix for the missing Overall Progress donut chart visualization in the Magellan EV Tracker v2.0.

## Changes Made

1. Fixed the JavaScript initialization for the donut chart in `static/js/core/app.js`:
   - Updated the `initVisualization` function to properly initialize the donut chart when a project is selected
   - Added proper error handling if the DonutChart module is not loaded

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload this package to Railway.app
2. The application should deploy without any errors
3. Access the application and select a project from the dropdown
4. The Overall Progress donut chart should now appear on the dashboard

## Known Issues

The following issues are still present and will be addressed in subsequent updates:

1. Unable to add Rules of Credit to Cost Codes
2. Unable to add Sub Jobs to Projects

## Testing Notes

- The donut chart will display 0% if there are no work items with progress for the selected project
- The chart is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes
- The chart displays both the percentage and actual/budgeted hours

## Next Steps

After testing this fix, we will proceed with addressing the remaining issues:
1. Fix the Rule of Credit in Cost Codes
2. Fix the Sub Job creation functionality
