# Magellan EV Tracker v2.0 - Comprehensive Fix Package

This package contains fixes for all three major issues identified in the Magellan EV Tracker v2.0:

1. Missing Overall Progress donut chart visualization
2. Unable to add Rules of Credit to Cost Codes
3. Unable to add Sub Jobs to Projects

## Changes Made

### 1. Donut Chart Visualization Fix
- Fixed JavaScript initialization in index.html to explicitly call loadData() after chart creation
- Enhanced the visualization base component with better debugging and error handling
- Improved the donut chart component with robust data validation and fallback rendering
- Added detailed logging throughout to help diagnose any issues

### 2. Rule of Credit in Cost Codes Fix
- Fixed variable name mismatch in add_cost_code and edit_cost_code routes
- Changed variable name from 'rules_of_credit' to 'rules' to match template expectations
- Ensured consistent naming across all related templates and routes

### 3. Sub Job Creation Fix
- Fixed template name mismatch in add_subjob route
- Updated route to use the correct template name ('add_sub_job.html' instead of 'add_subjob.html')
- Maintained compatibility with existing aliases and workflows

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload this package to Railway.app
2. The application should deploy without any errors
3. Test all three fixed functionalities:
   - Select a project to verify the donut chart appears
   - Add a cost code with a rule of credit
   - Add a sub job to a project

## Testing Notes

- The donut chart will display 0% if there are no work items with progress for the selected project
- The chart is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes
- Rules of credit should now appear in the dropdown when adding or editing cost codes
- Sub job creation should work without template errors

## Next Steps

After confirming all fixes work correctly, we can proceed with implementing additional dashboard visualizations as requested:
1. Progress Histogram
2. S-Curve
3. Quantity Distribution
4. Schedule Performance Index
