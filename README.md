3. Unable to add Sub Jobs to Projects ✅ (Fixed in previous package)
4. **NEW**: Sub jobs and cost codes not appearing after creation ✅ (Fixed in this package)

## Changes Made in This Package

### 1. Parameter Naming Consistency Fixes
- Fixed inconsistent parameter naming between routes and templates
- Added proper route aliases with consistent parameter naming
- Ensured all templates use the same parameter names (`sub_job_id` vs `subjob_id`)

### 2. Enhanced Transaction Handling
- Added robust error logging with full tracebacks
- Implemented verification steps to confirm data is actually saved
- Added explicit transaction commit checks and validation

### 3. Improved Error Reporting
- Added detailed logging throughout the data flow
- Added verification of database operations at each step
- Implemented better error handling for database transactions

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload this package to Railway.app
2. The application should deploy without any errors
3. Test all fixed functionalities:
   - Select a project to verify the donut chart appears
   - Add a cost code with a rule of credit and verify it appears in the list
   - Add a sub job to a project and verify it appears in the list
   - View sub job details to verify no URL building errors

## Testing Notes

- The donut chart will display 0% if there are no work items with progress for the selected project
- The chart is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes
- Rules of credit should now appear in the dropdown when adding or editing cost codes
- Sub job creation should work without template errors
- **IMPORTANT**: Newly created sub jobs and cost codes should now appear in their respective lists

## Next Steps

After confirming all fixes work correctly, we can proceed with implementing additional dashboard visualizations as requested:
1. Progress Histogram
2. S-Curve
3. Quantity Distribution
4. Schedule Performance Index
